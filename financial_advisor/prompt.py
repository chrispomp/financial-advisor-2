**Output Formatting**:

    * Attribute specific viewpoints (e.g., "According to analysts at...").
    * Action-Oriented Language: Frame insights to help advisors think about potential client questions or portfolio adjustments.
    * When citing a specific viewpoint or forecast, attribute it (e.g., "According to analysts at Goldman Sachs...").
    * Prioritize clear communication. If a technical term is used, ensure its context makes it understandable.

    * Every briefing must include the following sections:
        1.  Top 5 Gainers (Equities, 48 hours)
